# Gara'jal the Spiritbinder

- Two healers.
- Lust when the boss enrages at 20% health.
- 1 phase fight, plus the spirit world.
- Pick 1 healer and 2 dps to enter the spirit world. Assign backups in case one of the assigned gets voodoo doll.
- There are several totems floating in the air. At some point the boss will place one of those totems on the ground. The assigned spirit world party will stand close to the totem and then everyone kills the totem to allow the party to enter the spirit world.
- When banished to the spirit world, you have 30 seconds to kill as many mobs as possible before you die.
- The healer in the spirit world heals the group to full health, which gives the ability to leave the spirit world. Extra Action Button.
- The mobs in the spirit world damage players in the physical world.
- If the tank gets banished to the spirit world, they need to kill the Severer of Souls and then they can return to the physical world.
- The tank without voodoo doll should taunt the boss.  Voodoo doll prevents people from entering the spirit world and Voodoo Doll copies 70% of their damage received to all other Voodoo Dolls in the raid. The boss will just go back to the voodoo doll tank when the taunt wears off, but the reduced damage due to voodoo doll helps.

> Healers should focus on healing the 3 people in the spirit realm (themselves included) as much as possible during the 30 seconds in there, even if they are at full HP. All healing that healers receive grants them a substantial mana regen buff for a moderate duration once they leave, and all healing that DPS receive grants them a substantial DPS increasing buff. The potency of these buffs scales with how much healing that person received in the spirit realm.
