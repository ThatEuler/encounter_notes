One of each boss abilities continues to go off after the boss dies.  They accumulate over the 4 part fight.

## Qiang the Merciless

- Moving as a team is important.
- Run behind the boss during `Annialate`.
- Stand in front of the boss during `Massive Attacks`.
- Stop attacking when the shield comes out. `Impervious Shield`.
- Avoid the line of mobs, `Flanking Orders`.  This ability persists.

## Subtai the Swift

- He casts a cone of arrows, 3x, in front of him. `Volley`.  Move out.
- `Pillage`. He targets a player and runs toawrd them. Everyone move out. Everyone within 8 yards takes a debuff and loses their gear for 8 seconds. This ability persists.
  - He spins. There's a red circle that shows the 8 yard range.
- `Rain of Arrows`. Fires arrows that land in an 8 yard area pinning those hit.  Stay in a lose spread during this boss. Ranged stay a bit further back, rumour is that you will be chosen. Tank will move the boss to the arrows so they can be cleaved, freeing the pinned player.
  - The first time I did this in another group, everyone was tightly stacked and we all got hit by the arrows. Since no one could attack, we watched as the boss picked us off one by one.
- (heroic only?) `Sleight of Hand`. Attacking while this is active will give you a big damage and healing debuff.  It can be stunned.

## Meng the Demented

- `Madening Shout`. Makes us all enemies, we attack each other to break out.  So stack for AoE cleave.  This ability persists.
- During `Cowerdice` we might need to stop damage because of the damage reflect.
- `Crazy Thought`. Increases his fury. Try to interrupt it.

## Zian the Endless Shadow

- `Undying Shadows`. A mob will spawn and fixate on a player. That player should kite the mob to the edge of the room and then ranged should kill the mob.  The mob spawns a aoe damage field around it when it dies.
- Spread out to avoid `Shadow Blast` AoE damage.
