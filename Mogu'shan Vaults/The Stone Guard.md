# The Stone Guard

```
ability.name = "Jasper Overload" or ability.name = "Jade Overload" or ability.name = "Cobalt Overload"
```

## Strats

- stack strat.  stack all boss together and use defensives to survive overload.  The advantage here is that with cleave the boss dies faster when all 3 are together.  The disadvantage is that all 3 overloads go off at the same time.  Still tank swap to minimize Rend Flesh stacks.
- traditional strat. move bosses so that only one overload goess off at a time and its the boss whose bosses petrification is up.

## ITT Run

- No Amethyst Guardian this week.
- We didn't do the stack strat.
- Tanks keep 2 bosses together and 1 off.  Rotate the off boss every 25 energy. (maybe? TLDR guide says to do this)
- Main tank tanks on the left side. Off tank on the right. Why not every 50 energy?
- There's no boss cleave so its OK to stand n front of the boss.
- The main tank takes the boss that is casting petrify. The non petrifying bosses are swapped.
- Tanks get `Rend Flesh` debuff. Is there a fancy tank swap strat to minimize Rend Flesh for the petrifying boss?
- Boss energy and Petrification are different timers. Need to make sure that Energy reaches 100 before Petrification does. Overload at 100 energy resets Petrification.
- <span style="color:red">**Jasper Chains**</span> When you get chained to someone, stack together to minimize damage. Falls off after 30 seconds. When Jasper Petrification is active move 10 yards apart and the chains will fall off after 15 seconds. The Fojji WA gives an audible alert "Break Chains".
- <span style="color:green">**Jade Shards**</span> Random players get targeted. Just heal through it. If you're low health, use a defensive.
- <span style="color:blue">**Cobalt Mine**</span> Pop the mine when Cobalt petrification is active.  Or pop it when a defensive is active. The game draws a circle around the mine so you know what to avoid. You get rooted when you pop the mine, but it can be dispeled. Magic dispel.  Root might be heroic only.
- <span style="color:purple">**Amethyst Pool**</span> Stay out of the pool. It disappears after 1.5 minutes.
