## Stone Guards

- 2 strats.
  - stack strat.  stack all boss together and use defensives to survive overload.  The advantage here is that with cleave the boss dies faster when all 3 are together.  The disadvantage is that all 3 overloads go off at the same time.
  - traditional strat. move bosses so that overload goes off when that bosses petrification is up.

- No Amethyst Guardian this week.
- We didn't do the stack strat.
- **Jasper Chains**. When you get chained to someone, stack together to minimize damage.  When Jasper Petrification is active (green bar) move 10 yards apart and the chains will fall off after 15 seconds. The Fojji WA gives an audible alert "Break Chains".
- **Jasper Shards**. Random players get targeted. There's a red circle on the ground under you if you get targeted. Move out of the circle.  Keep a loose spread because the damage is aoe.  If you're chained to someone, both move together.
