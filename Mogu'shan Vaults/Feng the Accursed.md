# Feng the Accursed

- Left crystal is Reveral - Off Tank
- Right crystal is Shield - Main Tank
- Lust on Stage 3 - Spirit of the Staff
- There's no cleave. Its ok to stand in front of the boss.

## Stage 1 - Spirit of the Fist - Northeast statue

- Tank swap on 2 stacks of Lightning Lash - 131788
- Lightning Fists - Lightning travels quickly along the floor to move out of the way.
- Epicentre - Damages the tanks and melee.  Healers and ranged should stay at max range.  Tanks alternate Shield and Reversal to mitigate Epicentre.

> Before Feng uses Epicenter a second time, the tank with Shroud of Reversal should use this ability on the other tank right before Feng uses Lightning Fists on that tank. By doing this, the Shroud tank will be able to use Lightning Fists on Feng. Lightning Fists has the ability to interrupt Epicenter and should be saved for when Feng begins to cast it.

## Stage 2 - Spirit of the Spear - Southeast statue

- Tank swap at 2 stacks of Flame Spear - 116942.
- Ranged and healers stand in the middle of the area. Same place as stage 1.  Melee stand on the far side of the Wildfire drop spot. Tank close to the drop spot.
- If you are the target is Wildfire Spark, run out to the side of the area. Pick a spot and put up a raid marker.  Let the Wildfire start, then run back.
- Put down the barrier when he channels draw flame. The barrier should be in between the boss and the wildfires. The tank is standing there already. Do it on the second draw flame.


## Stage 3 - Spirit of the Staff - Southwest statue

- Tank swap at 2 stacks of Arcane Shock - 131790.
- If you get targeted with Arcane Resonance (purple circle) run out of the group asap.
- Use the shield to counter the first cast of Arcane Storm.  We didn't do this. Arcane Storm easy to heal through. But we can consider trying this. Its probably needed for heroic.  The problem here is that if Arcane Resonance goes off while we're stacked, its a wipe.  Need to pre-spread.
- Stay in a loose stack around the boss. Arcane Storm does more damage the further people are from the boss, so stack close. But keep a loose stack so that slow exit from Arcane Resonance hurts fewer people.

## Spirit of the Shield - Northwest statue

Heroic Only
