# Glubtok

- This fight is a tank and spank.
- No interrupts, no dispels.
- When he casts Firewall in phase 2, try to be on the same side of the wall as the tank. But not a big deal if you're not.

# Helix Gearbreaker

- No interrupts, no dispels.
- Avoid the sticky bombs on the floor.  Sticky bombs go off if a player is within 1 yard and knockback players within 3 yards. Easy to heal through in a geared group.
- After Helix jumps on then off a player's back he leaves a chest bomb on them. Knocks the player up in the air and does 6 yard AoE damage. Stay under the bridge to minimize downtime. Easy to heal through in a geared group.

# Foe Reaper 5000

- No interrupts, no dispels.
- Heroic only. The mechanics are important for this fight.  One DPS needs to pilot the reaper prototype and tank the molten slags away from the boss.
- Reaper rotation: 1, 1, 2. Reaper Strike, Reaper Strike, Reaper Charge.
- As long as someone uses the Reaper its an easy fight.  If its still a challenge, tank the boss at the top of the ramp and put the Reaper halfway up the ramp.

# Admiral Ripsnarl

- No interrupts, no dispels.
- Simple fight. Kill the adds, kill the boss.

# "Captain" Cookie

- No interrupts, no dispels.  The food debuff is dispeled by eating the good food.
- No threat table. No need to tank.
- Click the good food, avoid the rotten food.  With good damage/healing the rotten food can be ignored.
- The rotten food does a small amount of AoE damge (verified?). If there gets to be to much rotten food on deck, eating food immediately after eating rotten food will clean up the rotten food while keep the haste buff from the good food and losing the debuff from the rotten food.

# Vanessa VanCleef

- Deflection: For 10 seconds deflects melee, ranged and spell attacks. The damage is not reflected back to the attacker. Existing DoTs still damage the boss. Switch to adds.
- At 50% and 25% health she will detonate explosives on the ship.  Use the ropes or stand right at the edge of the ship where the ropes are to avoid the damage.
