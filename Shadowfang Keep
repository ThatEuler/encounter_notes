# Baron Ashbury

- Interrupt or dispel `Pain and Suffering`. 8 second cast time and 8 second DoT.
- The boss will cast `Asphyxiate` to reduce everyone to 1 HP and then `Stay of Execution` to heal people.  Don't interrupt `Stay of Execution` unless you're going for the achievement.
- People can die when they get to 1 HP, but its rare.
- In low DPS groups, save cooldowns for the enrage which happens when the boss casts `Calamity` at 25% health.  When the boss casts this spell he says: `I grow tired of this hunt... Time to die!`.

# Baron Silverlaine

- Groups with good DPS can ignore the mechanics, except maybe for `Veil of Shadow`.
- `Veil of Shadow`, cast by the boss, is a dispellable curse. 75% healing reduction. This one should be dispelled, the other debuffs can usually be ignored.
- `Cursed Veil`, cast by the boss, is a dispellable magical debuff.
- `Blinding Shadows`, cast by Odo the Blindwatcher, is a dispellable magical debuff.
- `Soul Drain`, cast by Rethilgore, is a dispellable magical debuff.
- At each 25% health the boss summons a new add to the fight. Low DPS groups should switch and kill the adds, high DPS groups can stay on the boss.

# Commander Springvale

- Tank the boss away from the group since he does a Cleave.
- Interrupt `Unholy Empowerment` cast by the adds. 2.5 second cast time.
- Shadow damage resistance helps.
- The boss periodically casts `Desecration` on the groud. Yellow effect.  Melee and Tank should move out of it.
- Tank the boss along the walls to minimze caster movement and reduce the damage from `Desecration`.
- Kill the adds first.  Groups with good AoE damage can handle the adds that way.
- High DPS requirement. Can be skipped.

# Lord Walden

- `Conjure Poisonous Mixture` is a dispellable poison effect.
- Shadow, Nature and Frost resistance helps.
- When he casts `Icy Shards`, keep moving to avoid getting hit.
- DBM helps a lot in this fight.
- When he casts green `Unstable Mixture`, keep moving (jump) to avoid the damage.
- When he casts red `Unstable Mizture`, stand still to avoid the damage.

# Lord Godfrey

- Shadow resistance helps. Especially for `Pistol Barrage`.
- Interrupt `Cursed Bullets`.
- The most important mechanic is be aware of is `Pistol Barrage` which is cast after summoning ghouls.  Move out of the AoE cone.
- For extra style, knock back the adds into the Pistol Barrage.
